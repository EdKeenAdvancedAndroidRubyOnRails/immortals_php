            <p>Welcome to the home of the Immortals on the web.</p>
            <p>The Immortals are a group that believe birth, life and death exist in the same moment.  With the adjustment of perception,
                    a passion for life is found. Life as manifestation of the subjective into objective form. The Will moves energy into outer expression.</p>
            <p>Within these pages we hope to encompass ideas not commonly believed as we feel that is how paradigms  get changed. </p>
            <p>We are truly immortal beings having an experience in form. </p>
            <p>Form that can be created at WILL.</p>
